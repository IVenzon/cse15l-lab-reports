# CSE 15L Week 7 Lab Report: CLDQ – CSE Labs “Done Quick”

*Ian Venzon - Thursday 12:00 PM - B270*

## The Tasks:

In this lab report, we will be trying to complete a list of 9 tasks as quickly as possible by any means necessary. Our job is to complete the following:

1) **Setup pt. 1:** Delete any existing forks of the repo on your github account and on your ieng6 account.
2) **Setup pt. 2:** Fork the following [repository](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7).
3) Start the timer!
4) Log into your ieng6 account.
5) Clone the fork you made of the [repository](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7).
6) Run the tests (They should fail here!).
7) Edit the code to fix whatever is causing the failures.
8) Run the tests again (They should all pass here!)
9) Commit and push the changes you made to your GitHub account.

While these tasks are fairly straightforward, there are lots of ways to optimize your execution of them to lessen the amount of time needed or the amount of keystrokes used (hopefully both!).

## My (admittedly slow) approach:

The first three steps are the same for every person, so I won't really go in depth here. For step 1, if you can't find where to delete your fork of the repository, first go to your fork of the repo and click the "Settings" tab. Scroll all the way to the bottom of the page, and then click the "Delete this repository" button.
