## The grep command:

In this lab report, the command we will be taking a look at is `grep`. The `grep` command takes in a patten, then searches a file for the given pattern. It will then display all of the lines that contain said pattern. The syntax for `grep` is given by the following:

```
grep [options] pattern [files]
```
